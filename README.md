Battleship!

Battleship is a game about sinking all of your opponents ships before they sink yours. 
The goal is to pick random coordiantes on a 10x10 grid in hopes of landing a hit on the opponents ship. You cannot 
see each others boards and the game relies completely on luck and some skill. 

You start the game by placing 5 ships: Destroyer(2), Submarine(3), Cruiser(3), Battleship(4) and Carrier(5).
The number represents the length of each ship and that is how many times it must be hit before it will sink.
You then take turns guessing coordinates until one of the players destroys all of the enemy ships and wins the game.
